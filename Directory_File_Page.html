      <p>
        From a young age, I was an avid reader who immersed myself in stories across many genres—fantasy, science fiction, mystery, drama, and more.
        This wide exposure not only fueled my imagination but also helped me understand the deep emotional and intellectual power stories can have.
        I began writing as a way to express myself and explore ideas that fascinated me.<br><br>

        Alongside my love for reading, I also spent years as a dedicated gamer. I wasn't just drawn to games for their mechanics or entertainment,
        but for their stories—the worlds they built, the characters that lived in them, and the choices that gave players a voice.
        Games like these made me feel something, and I realized that interactive storytelling could be one of the most powerful mediums for emotional and meaningful experiences.<br><br>

        At first, I pursued a different path in college, studying Medical Technology at FEU for three years. That experience gave me discipline, attention to detail, and a strong scientific foundation.
        But deep down, I felt the pull toward storytelling and creativity. I eventually followed my passion and shifted to studying Information Technology with a specialization in Animation and Game Development.<br><br>

        What I want to do now is create stories of my own—original worlds, characters, and narratives—and bring them to life through games.
        I want people not just to read or hear my stories, but to feel them, live them, and shape them through gameplay.
        My ultimate goal is to blend my love for writing and gaming into experiences that resonate deeply with players—where games become a medium for storytelling, emotion, and connection.
