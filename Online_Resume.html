    <p>My passion for reading ignited my ambition to write stories at a young age. I was drawn to complex stories and well-developed characters, and I wanted to use storytelling as a means of writing and expressing myself.</p>
    <p> I pursued this interest, I saw how effective a storytelling medium video games are. My inspiration to study programming came from the player interactions and immersive worlds; programming is a necessary skill to make my writings come to life. I want to create engaging and inspiring interactive experiences by fusing my passions for writing, gaming, and reading.</p>
