      Granada is the first friend I had at highschool that I like going with as we have the same preference for everything, the most memorable thing i could think on the top of my head is the day we first met as the auditoruim were we just talking about random things and its started going to things we like to videos or youtubers we watch, like sundee talking about (his firing his lazer)
