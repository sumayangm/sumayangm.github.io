<div style="text-align:justify;">one of the most unforgatable memories i have with Chuchu is that one time at elementary days we were playing dodge ball with the guys and due to how big and large, as in he was tall and muscular. each hit of his ball kept making sound breaking noise that everyone was afraid of being hit. so everyone was gone and i was the last their, and when matthew threw the ball instead of me dodging it and just held my ground and with a casual grab from the air i miraculaously have it in my hand and with that i was able to revive and friend he was tossed back out as he was targeted.</div>
